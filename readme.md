# Coding Facts Generator

This Python script generates random coding facts, computer science trivia, and shortcuts using the PyWebIO library to create a web-based interface. Users can click a button to get a new fact displayed in a visually appealing format.

## Features

- Displays random coding facts and computer science trivia.
- User-friendly web interface created with PyWebIO.
- "More Facts" button to generate new facts on demand.
- Visually appealing presentation with styled text.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The PyWebIO library. You can install it using pip:
